# lsstack64
Process execution stack tracer for x86_64 architecture. Per-thread tracing is possible.  
A fork of the pstack utility for Solaris which works only on x86 arch. Originally it's not even compilable on x86_64. The current project is an attempt to make it work on x86_64 Linux.  
  
[Sample output](http://paste.ubuntu.com/11886313/) with Leafpad editor that runs 2 threads.

# License

While the original utility is GPLv2, the current project is licensed under **GPLv3**.  

# Compilation
Tested on Ubuntu 14.04.3 x86_64  

    $ sudo apt-get install binutils-dev libiberty-dev libunwind8-dev
    $ git clone https://github.com/jarun/lsstack64
    $ cd lsstack64
    $ make
    $ sudo make install

# Usage
LWP stands for `Light Weight Process`. In simpler terms it is the thread ID.  
It is shown in the fourth column in the output of  

    $ ps -aeLf
For the main thread of a process LWD == PID, for child threads they are different.

    $ unwind LWP

You might need to use `sudo` if you are not the owner of the process.
unwind is the test program on x86_64. The functionality will be merged to lsstack64.

# News  

16 Jul 2015: Implemented thread tracing support.

03 Jun 2015: Merging unwind.c fnctionality to lsstack64 started. New logging mechanism incorporated into lsstack64.  

25 Apr 2015: unwind.c is the new stub progam that uses libunwind to run through all the stack frames. The goal is to make unwind provide the information that pstack did.  

23 Apr 2015: log.h and log.c demonstrate a tiny, easy to use and extensible logging frameowork with severity level and useful information for easy debugging.  

15 Apr 2015: After some research, it turns out that x86_64 does NOT save the previous frame's frame pointer in RBP register (other than those compiled without -fomit-frame-pointer in GCC). The default optimization level in GCC is O2, which includes -fomit-frame-pointer. So the next strategy would be to use [libunwind] (http://www.nongnu.org/libunwind/).
