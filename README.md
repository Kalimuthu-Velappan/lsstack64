# lsstack64
lsstack for x86_64 architecture
A fork from pstack utility for Solaris which works only for x86 arch. Originally it's not even compilable on x86_64. The current project is an attempt to make it work on x86_64.

NOTE: While the original utility is GPLv2, the current project is licensed under GPLv3.
