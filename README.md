# lsstack64
lsstack for x86_64 architecture.  
A fork of the pstack utility for Solaris which works only for x86 arch. Originally it's not even compilable on x86_64. The current project is an attempt to make it work on x86_64 Linux.  
  
# License  
  
While the original utility is GPLv2, the current project is licensed under GPLv3.

# Instructions (tested on Ubuntu 14.04 x86_64)  

Compilation:  
$ git clone https://github.com/jarun/lsstack64  
$ cd lsstack64  
$ make  
$ sudo make install  
  
Usage:  
$ unwind PID  
// as long as you are the owner of the process, use sudo otherwise  
// unwind is the test program on x86_64. The functionality will be merged to lsstack64.

# News  

16 Jul 2015: Implemented thread tracing support.

03 Jun 2015: Merging unwind.c fnctionality to lsstack64 started. New logging mechanism incorporated into lsstack64.  

25 Apr 2015: unwind.c is the new stub progam that uses libunwind to run through all the stack frames. The goal is to make unwind provide the information that pstack did.  

23 Apr 2015: log.h and log.c demonstrate a tiny, easy to use and extensible logging frameowork with severity level and useful information for easy debugging.  

15 Apr 2015: After some research, it turns out that x86_64 does NOT save the previous frame's frame pointer in RBP register (other than those compiled without -fomit-frame-pointer in GCC). The default optimization level in GCC is O2, which includes -fomit-frame-pointer. So the next strategy would be to use libunwind (http://www.nongnu.org/libunwind/).
